                <p>
                    Many people in the UK suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) in the winter months, which causes low mood and lack
                    of energy. This is thought to be linked to lack of sunlight – but what is the science behind this condition and how can
                    it be treated?
                </p>
                <p>
                    One theory centres around vitamin D. This is an essential biochemical in a number of body processes, including healthy
                    bone formation, but unlike vitamin C it is not readily found in our normal diet. It is, however, produced by our own
                    bodies – but only in the presence of sunlight. So the winter months often lead to low levels of vitamin D in our bodies
                    – this has led to the proposed connection between SAD and vitamin D. This potential link is backed up by biochemical
                    evidence, as vitamin D is also linked to levels of serotonin – a biochemical known to be depleted in many cases of
                    depression.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Furthermore, a significant number of patients with depression have been shown to have vitamin D deficiency.
                    However, the data are not yet clear enough to confirm whether prescribing vitamin D would be an effective treatment, and
                    if so at what dose: further studies are ongoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NICE guidelines in the UK do not specifically recommend vitamin D to treat SAD, but this may well change if more
                    conclusive evidence emerges. And in fact, seasonal vitamin D supplements are already recommended for all adults in the
                    UK based on the high number of people with vitamin D deficiency generally in the UK population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for people suffering from SAD it may be worth discussing the option of high-dose vitamin D supplements with a
                    GP. Watch out for unfolding news on this topic as studies are still underway to confirm its role. In the meantime,
                    perhaps one of the simplest approaches to help boost mood and vitamin D levels is to take a mid-day walk in the winter
                    whenever possible - always making sure to use sun cream if needed.
