Description:

Knowledge Nexus is a biology revision and learning resources tool for key-stages 3 and 4(GCSE). It's aim is to provide an all-in-one directory for revision resources, including links to various trusted external revision sites, as well as details and information about personal tutors in the south-east of England. The website also contains a blog, which would discuss a science related topic that is either in the news, or relevent to current events. 

The website is intended to make it easier to find reliable revision resources, rather than remembering and keeping track of these yourself. Additionally, there is a function for users to get in contact for additional information, particularly regarding tutoring.
