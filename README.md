**Description**:

Knowledge Nexus is a science revision and learning resources tool for key-stages 3 and 4(GCSE). It's aim is to provide an all-in-one directory for revision resources, including links to various trusted external revision sites, as well as details and information about personal tutors in the south-east of England. The website also contains a blog, which would discuss a science related topic that is either in the news, or relevent to current events. 

The website is intended to make it easier to find reliable revision resources, rather than remembering and keeping track of these yourself. Additionally, there is a function for users to get in contact for additional information, particularly regarding tutoring.

**Design:**

The colors for the website were chosen with readability and ease of use in mind, with the colours chosen providing contrast, whilst still being easy on the eye. The design of the site is simple and intuitive, and presents users with unambiguous navigation options.

Users can use the contact page to view details of science tutors, as well as submit their own queries - with a textarea feature to allow users provide detail to their request.
