**Description**:

Knowledge Nexus is a science revision and learning resources tool for key-stages 3 and 4(GCSE). It's aim is to provide an all-in-one directory for revision resources, including links to various trusted external revision sites, as well as details and information about personal tutors in the south-east of England. The website also contains a blog, which would discuss a science related topic that is either in the news, or relevent to current events. 

The website is intended to make it easier to find reliable revision resources, rather than remembering and keeping track of these yourself. Additionally, there is a function for users to get in contact for additional information, particularly regarding tutoring.

**Design:**

The colors for the website were chosen with readability and ease of use in mind, with the colours chosen providing contrast, whilst still being easy on the eye. The design of the site is simple and intuitive, and presents users with unambiguous navigation options. This is done through clear options visible at the top of the page.

The imagery used has a science theme throughout, and helps to convey the website's purpose clearly.

**Features:**

Home page:

The home page is simple, and immediately tells users what to expect from the site, and what it can be used for. 

Resources:

The resources page acts as a directory to a selection of useful external resources, including a short description about each one. 

Blog:

The blog page features a short article about a relevent science topic. It is displayed in a clear format with information broken down into digestible paragraphs. The title, author, and date of posting are clearly visable at the top of the page, and the information sources are also listed below the article.

Contact:

Visitors can use the contact page to view details of science tutors, as well as submit their own queries - with a textarea feature to allow users provide detail to their request. The information on this page is displayed clearly, and is designed to allow users to very easily use the featured content.


--------------
**Testing:**

The website was tested thouroughly to ensure it functions and displays as indended. The below tools were used to test and validate the site.

- Github pages - a deployed version of the site was launched prior to the project end in order to make sure elements like interactivity and responsiveness were consistent outside of the building environment. All 
                 features functioned as intended. All social media, external website, and email links function correctly.

- W3C HTML validation - no errors are returned when passing the HTML pages through this validator

- W3C CSS validator - no errors are returned when passing the CSS document through this validator

- Am I Responsive and Responsinator - using these websites it was possible to determine what the site would look like on different devices. All pages displayed as intended with the appropriate responsiveness.
